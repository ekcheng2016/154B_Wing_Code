% calc_wxwy.m
%
% Description:
%   This function calculates the force distribution in the x and y
%   directions.  The notation is defined from ROOT to TIP
%
% Inputs:
%   n       : load factor
%   rho     : air density               (kg/m^3)
%   V       : velocity                  (m/s)
%   AoA     : angle of attack           (rad)
%   Cd      : airfoil drag coefficient  (-)
%   nz      : number of z increments    (-)
%
% Outputs:
%   wx0 : force distribution in the x-direction from root to tip  (N/m)
%   wy0 : force distribution in the y-direction from root to tip  (N/m)
%   wx  : force distribution in the x-direction from tip to root  (N/m)
%   wy  : force distribution in the y-direction from tip to root  (N/m)
